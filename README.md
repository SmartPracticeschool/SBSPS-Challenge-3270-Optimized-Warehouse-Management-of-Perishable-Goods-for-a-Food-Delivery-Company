## Introduction
This is a Software model on Demand Forecasting of perishable goods using machine learning solutions.

## Proposed Solution
The machine learning Model solution has been prepared which should have the ability to predict accurately. And the accuracy can be achieved if more data is provided.
Hence More data Gives More Accuracy in demand Forecasting. (Three years of data is considered for prediction)
In this model, the demand forecasting for vegetables is predicted.
The Factors that are taken into consideration for demand forecasting are:-
Seasonal Changes affect demand forecasting.
Quantity of the crop arrival also affects.
Demand also depends on the type of crop. (Onion, Tomato, Potato are considered for demand prediction)
The region also affects crop demand. (Major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata,Hyderbad,Bengaluru,Ahmedabad are considered for demand prediction)
Login and Logout feature has been added to ensure security.

## Software Designing
A solution model has been created using Node-red Application and Watson Stdio.The web App with Machine learning model can provide the Solution prediction accurately.

## Applications
- Used in food industries.
- Used in warehouse management.
- Machine learning techniques allow predicting the amount of products to be purchased during a defined future period.
- Compared to traditional demand forecasting methods, machine learning accelerates data processing speed

## Conclusion
Therefore, our project can be used to predict the price and arrival quantity of perishable food products in future. 


## Future Scope
The growing demand of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in almost every industry is compelling the employees across the globe to learn new skills in Data science. It is said that AI and ML are expected to impact and transform our lives in ways beyond imagination similar to the internet.
Fortunately for demand planners, ML can now help further improve the forecast from 40% of actual to 70% of actual. 
Machine Learning can predict future weather patterns at the local level and identify how it connects to local demand patterns. Machine Learning can also determine if a lag exists between the weather changes and the demand of products on a real-time basis. The life cycle of a product plays a critical role in demand forecasting.
